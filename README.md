# Notepad

![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/WilliamKSIlva/notepad-app)

- Project in progress, keep in mind that things can change until final version. Thank you very much!! 

In this react native application my main goal is provide an app that the User can use to write and storage all the things that he wants to put it out! That can be a beautiful poem or a recipe? Or maybe just a momentaneum thought that comes to his mind.
